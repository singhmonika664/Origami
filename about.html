Hello Friends!! This is Ishita Jain. I am a 9th class student.My hobby is coding and creating wonderful games in it.Apart form that I also like making various designs through origmai sheets.I will also give you some of my coding links in the description.
I have opened this website in order to help people in creating many different types of animals with the origamis without difficulty.
These links which I have given in the website can take you to some of the easiest but lovely designs that one definitely wants to create and it also helps in home decor.
<br><br>
Earlier I just used to send these links to my friends and asked them to share it further.But when I thought that it is just not those people.There are millions and millions who would like to explore this world of origami.Then my mother suggested me to make  a website to help and be favourite of millions.
<br> I HOPE YOU WILL LIKE MY EFFORT!!ðŸ’•ðŸ’•  Friends more veiwing my more projects kindly scroll below 
ðŸ‘‡ and you will find them.Try playing them by just clicking on the image.
